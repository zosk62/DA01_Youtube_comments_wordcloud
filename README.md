# 📊 YouTube Comments Wordcloud Analysis

## 📚 Language, Tools, and Libraries

### 🖥️ Programming Language
The analysis and code for this project were primarily conducted using the Python programming language.

### 🧰 Tools
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The code was developed and tested in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### 📚 Libraries
The following Python libraries were crucial for the implementation of this analysis:
- **pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **konlpy:** A Korean natural language processing library for text analysis.
- **matplotlib:** Employed for data visualization, including the creation of the word cloud.
- **streamlit:** Utilized for building an interactive and engaging user interface for the analysis results.

## 🎯 Objective and Methodology

For this analysis, a specific YouTube video was carefully selected, and its content, along with all associated comments, was systematically extracted and stored in a CSV file. Following the extraction process, an in-depth word analysis was conducted to identify patterns and enable psychological insights. The results were beautifully visualized using a word cloud.

## 🌐 Word Cloud Generation

The word cloud generation process involved retrieving comments from the YouTube API, processing the data using pandas and konlpy, and visualizing the results using matplotlib and streamlit. The word cloud provides a captivating graphical representation of the top 50 word frequencies, offering a quick and intuitive understanding of viewer sentiments.

## 📈 Analysis and Interpretation

In addition to the visually appealing word cloud, further analysis and interpretation were performed to extract insightful findings from the comments. The most-liked comment, along with its content, is highlighted in the analysis.

## 🖼️ Visualization

The analysis results come to life in an interactive streamlit app, providing an engaging user interface for exploring the word cloud and additional insights.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Through this comprehensive analysis, various compelling topics and issues related to energy generation in Korea were uncovered. The word cloud and analysis serve as a tool to understand opinions and issues related to energy policy formulation.
